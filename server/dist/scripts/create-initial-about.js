    description: `I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering at IES College of Technology under RGPV, I've dedicated myself to mastering the MERN stack and building impactful digital solutions.

My journey in tech has been marked by continuous learning and hands-on experience. From participating in hackathons like Smart India Hackathon 2023 where I reached the Grand Finale, to completing NPTEL certifications in IoT and Database Management Systems, I'm always pushing myself to grow and adapt to new challenges.

I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it's building a comprehensive news aggregation platform like TheNewsHive, creating AI-powered SaaS applications like Chitra AI, or developing enterprise solutions like UniPortal ERP system, I strive to create software that makes a meaningful impact.

Beyond coding, I'm passionate about exploring emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer community. I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible.`,
